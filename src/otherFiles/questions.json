This is what the D.E.O said in the letter.\\n                </p>\\n                <p>\\n                    All the head teachers of government and private schools must follow what the minister of Education\\n                    and\\n                    Sports said about\\n                    school holidays.The minister said that no primary school in the whole country is allowed to do any\\n                    teaching\\n                    during the school holidays.\\n                    All primary school children must be at home. They need a rest. Children work very hard at school for\\n                    three\\n                    months in a term\\n                    and so they need a rest. Some clever children have even written letters to the Ministry of Education\\n                    to\\n                    <u>\\n                        complain\\n                    </u>\\n                    that they\\n                    are being over worked by making them study during holidays. These children are right. Their brain\\n                    must\\n                    rest\\n                    for sometime.\\n                </p>\\n                <p>\\n                    Parents too must be informed that their children need a rest during school holidays. There are a\\n                    number\\n                    of\\n                    things parents\\n                    must remember if they want their children to rest\\n                    <u>\\n                        properly\\n                    </u>\\n                    during the holidays. The first one is\\n                    that\\n                    parents must\\n                    not look for private teachers to teach or coach their children during holidays.The child cannot\\n                    learn\\n                    much\\n                    at that time;\\n                    the brain is still very tired. The parent is therefore paying the private teacher money for doing\\n                    nothing to\\n                    the child.\\n                    The second thing to remember is that the children should do a lot of play while they are at home for\\n                    holidays. They can also\\n                    help their parents with some work.\\n                </p>\\n                <p>\\n                    Let me say it again. No teaching during the holidays.

        <p>\\n                    One week before the end of the school first term, the District Education Officer of Kibu District\\n                    wrote\\n                    a\\n                    letter to all the\\n                    head teachers of primary schools in the district. This is what the D.E.O said in the letter.\\n                </p>\\n                <p>\\n                    All the head teachers of government and private schools must follow what the minister of Education\\n                    and\\n                    Sports said about\\n                    school holidays.The minister said that no primary school in the whole country is allowed to do any\\n                    teaching\\n                    during the school holidays.\\n                    All primary school children must be at home. They need a rest. Children work very hard at school for\\n                    three\\n                    months in a term\\n                    and so they need a rest. Some clever children have even written letters to the Ministry of Education\\n                    to\\n                    <u>\\n                        complain\\n                    </u>\\n                    that they\\n                    are being over worked by making them study during holidays. These children are right. Their brain\\n                    must\\n                    rest\\n                    for sometime.\\n                </p>\\n                <p>\\n                    Parents too must be informed that their children need a rest during school holidays. There are a\\n                    number\\n                    of\\n                    things parents\\n                    must remember if they want their children to rest\\n                    <u>\\n                        properly\\n                    </u>\\n                    during the holidays. The first one is\\n                    that\\n                    parents must\\n                    not look for private teachers to teach or coach their children during holidays.The child cannot\\n                    learn\\n                    much\\n                    at that time;\\n                    the brain is still very tired. The parent is therefore paying the private teacher money for doing\\n                    nothing to\\n                    the child.\\n                    The second thing to remember is that the children should do a lot of play while they are at home for\\n                    holidays. They can also\\n                    help their parents with some work.\\n                </p>\\n                <p>\\n                    Let me say it again. No teaching during the holidays. My inspectors will be visiting schools,\\n                    classrooms\\n                    and\\n                    private places\\n                    to see if there is any teaching going on

She asked the pupils to apply for the posts.\\n            Many pupils applied including the well-known boy, Bouncer Bino also known as BB. He was known in the school because of his pride.\\n            He applied for the post of Head boy. As soon as BB handed in his application, he changed his style of walking.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n     Friday was the day for general campaigns. The chairperson called candidates to address the pupils. When BB was called upon,\\n            pupils cheered him “Our boy BB! Our boy BB! ” However, he was disturbed by something he had no money to please his supporters.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n     When he returned home that evening, he asked his dad for some money for the campaigns. BB was very excited when his dad gave \\n            him some money. he bought sweets, pan-cakes, buns and gave them quietly to every pupil he believed was his supporter. \\n            On the day of the elections, the head teacher, Mr. Matovu was there to monitor the process. He wanted to ensure that there was \\n            no\\n     <u>\\n      rigging\\n     </u>\\n     Indeed, there was free and fair elections.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n     When Ms. Dorothy Awor announced the results, a very humble boy who did not spend money was elected head boy. Bouncer Bino, \\n            had lost. He was very disappointed and so were his parents. BB accepted the results and advised his supporters to work together \\n            with the newly elected prefects.

The house were Nile, Victoria, Kyoga and Albert. Victoria had its leader Catherine. \\n            All teacher liked Catherine because she was hardworking and well behaved.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n     Catherine was at first doing well, as she was practicing with her house members daily. Time came when she was doing \\n            the opposite. She became proud of herself in front of other pupils. Whenever she was given some items like glucose and \\n            sugarcane to be given out during practice, Catherine kept them to go and share with her friends in the dormitory. \\n            Her behavior did not please the members of the house. They decided to report the matter to the house masters.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n     One morning, the teacher and pupils of Victoria house gathered to prepare for the general practice for all the houses. \\n            During the meeting, members talked about Catherine’s conduct. Some said that they had given up but the teacher advised \\n            Catherine to apologize to the members.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n     In the afternoon, the houses\\n     <u>\\n      assembled\\n     </u>\\n     for the practice.  This saw Victoria’s participants becoming last in each race. \\n            Catherine lost fame and became quiet. The rest of the houses beat Victoria in each and every event. After the general\\n            practice, Catherine called her members and apologized. She called upon them to regain house spirit. This made her\\n            buy glucose using some of her pocket money.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n     The awaited day came and participants assembled in the field. In the first event of the long race, the first and the \\n            third positions were taken by Victoria house. When the results of the field  events were brought the recording table, \\n            Victoria house was leading in most of them and this made Catherine and her house-mates  every happy.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n     Finally, result were announced.

These are farming and business. \\n            Most people are farmers. They grow different crops and rear chicken, goats, cattle. \\n            Men and women are both involved in the business. They sell different items including foodstuffs \\n            and animal products from their farms.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n     Mr. Amooti is among the well known businessmen in the area. He has the biggest shop. \\n            In his shop, there is a variety of items. Some are weighed in kilogrammes like sugar, \\n            maize flour, rice, beans and groundnuts. Others are packed in bottles, tins or packets \\n            like juice, soda, water, shoe polish, salt and baking flour.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n     If anyone needed paraffin or cooking oil, these would be measured in litres. They are also \\n            measured in small quantities as a person may require. There is hardly anything a person may \\n            want for home use that is not in Mr. Amooti’s shop.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n     In order to serve his many\\n     <u>\\n      customers\\n     </u>\\n     well, Mr. Amooti has employed some workers to help him. \\n            They all serve with a smile. More so, items in his shop are cheaper compared to those from other \\n            shops. When children go to buy from his shop, he sometimes gives them sweets. It is a reward for \\n            choosing to buy from his shop.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n     He has the biggest number of customers in the area. He\\n     <u>\\n      earns\\n     </u>\\n     a lot of money too.
